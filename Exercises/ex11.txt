When doing a search in Google for Rail/Ruby API, I found and OVERWHELMING amount of results.  I'm not sure where to start in understanding each of the sites to be able to pick the one I like best.  Instead, I compiled a list of sites that seem easy to understand and are well laid out.

api.rubyonrails.org
  guides.rubyonrails.org
  
https://github.com/rails/rails

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/
